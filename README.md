A simple PHP eCommerce website application through Treehouse

My very first PHP project through Treehouse. Details coming soon.

**Update 9/29/15**: Following along with the "Enhance a PHP Website" project on Treehouse, I will be revisiting this project shortly to improve on existing code! I'm excited to see how far I've come since first learning PHP and object-oriented programming principles.
